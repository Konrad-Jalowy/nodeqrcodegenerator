# nodeqrcodegenerator
**im gonna be honest - far simpler than it sounds. From-scratch node.js cli apps doing copy, rename, sort files by date and all "boring" stuff ive done were more complicated. Done with great udemy course, understand it fully, its actually very simple project. But i need "experience" so i try my best to get it. Nice to know 2 interesting libraries, but i think i prefer readlines to inquirer. Its kinda funny, that when you show to someone not very oriented in technology that you can copy, rename, sort by date and all other stuff which is complicated piece of algorithm, they dont care much. But you show them qr code generator and wow, youre some agent 007 now :)**
